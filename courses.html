            <h2>ECE244: Programming Fundamentals </h2>
            <p>This course provides a solid foundation in programming using C++, focusing on object-oriented programming
                principles. Topics covered include classes and objects, inheritance, basic data structures (such as
                lists, binary trees, and hash tables), Big-O complexity analysis, and testing and debugging techniques.
                Laboratory assignments emphasize the application of object-oriented constructs in the design and
                implementation of reasonably large programs.</p>

        <div class="course">
            <h2>APS105:Computer Fundamentals </h2>
            <p>This course serves as an introduction to computer systems and problem-solving using computers. Key topics
                covered include the representation of information within a computer, programming style, the use of loops
                for repetitive actions, modular programming through functions, arrays, strings, and pointer-based data
                structures, such as linked lists. Also there was some exploration in fundamental searching and sorting
                algorithms.</p>

        <div class="course">
            <h2>APS111 & APS112: Engineering Strategies & Practice</h2>
            <p>This course focuses on engineering design processes, project management, and teamwork. Students learn to
                apply engineering principles to solve real-world problems. Refer to <a href="projects.html">Projects
                </a> to see the projects that were completed within this course. The skills gained in project management
                and teamwork are essential in any type of engineering, where collaboration and adherence to timelines
                are critical for successful project completion. This course has prepared me to work effectively in
                diverse teams.

            <h2>ECE241: Digital Systems</h2>
            <p>This course focuses on the design and implementation of digital systems using Verilog. Topics include
                combinational and sequential logic design, and digital circuit simulation. This course has given me a
                foundation in designing system that require close collaboration between software and hardware.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="course">
            <h2>ECE231: Electronics</h2>
            <p>This course covers the basics of electronic devices, including components such as resistors, capacitors,
                and transistors, MOSFETS, BJT's and other circuit analysis techniques.Understanding electronics can be
                beneficial for working in embedded systems or hardware-software integration.</p>
